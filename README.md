# TOP-Landing-Page

In this project I made a landing page. During the curriculum from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) I had to make a landing page from scratch.

The Odin Project provided only two reference images. One showing the desired outcome and another with the required color scheme and font size.

This is the desired end result from The Odin Project:

These are the colors and some details I were given:
